       "\"Colette Kress: We delivered another record quarter while navigating what continues to be a dynamic external environment. Total revenue was $46.7 billion, exceeding our outlook as we grew sequentially across all market platforms. Data center revenue grew 56% year over year. Data center revenue also grew sequentially despite the $4 billion decline in H20 revenue. NVIDIA Corporation's Blackwell platform reached record levels, growing sequentially by 17%. We began production shipments of GB300 in Q2. Our full stack AI solutions for cloud service providers, Neo Clouds, enterprises, and sovereigns are all contributing to our growth. We are at the beginning of an industrial revolution that will transform every industry. We see $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by the end of the decade. The scale and scope of these build-outs present significant long-term growth opportunities for NVIDIA Corporation. The GB200 NBL system is seeing widespread adoption with deployments at CSPs and consumer Internet companies. Lighthouse model builders, including OpenAI, Meta, and Mastral, are using the GB200 NBL72 at data center scale for both training next-generation models and serving inference models in production. The new Blackwell Ultra platform has also had a strong quarter, generating tens of billions in revenue. The transition to the GB300 has been seamless for major cloud service providers due to its shared architecture, software, and physical footprint. The GB200 enables them to build and deploy GB300 racks with ease. The transition to the new GB300 rack-based architecture has been seamless. Factory builds in late July and early August were successfully converted to support the GV300 ramp. Today, full production is underway. The current run rate is back at full speed, producing approximately 1,000 racks per week. This output is expected to accelerate even further throughout the third quarter as additional capacity comes online. We expect widespread market availability in the second half of the year as CorWeave prepares to bring their GV300 instance to market as they are already seeing 10x more inference performance on reasoning models compared to H100. Compared to the previous Hopper generation, GV300 NDL72 AI factories promise a 10x improvement in token per watt energy efficiency, which translates to revenues as data centers are power limited. The chips of the Rubin platform are in fab. The Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, CX9 Supernic, NBLink 144 scale-up switch, SpectrumX scale-out and scale-across switch, and the silicon photonics processor. Rubin remains on schedule for volume production next year.\""
